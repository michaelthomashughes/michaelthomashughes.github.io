**Meetings - The Bane of the Software Engineer**

When we meet with others, our natural instinct is to expand on the conversation until every available minute is filled. No wonder so many meetings seem to drag on forever! But what if you could break free from this cycle and make the most of your time?

**The Parkinson's Law: How Meetings Can Expand Beyond Reasonable Bounds**

Parkinson's Law states that "work expands to fill the time available for its completion." This means that if a meeting is scheduled for 60 minutes, it'll likely take the full hour.

To combat this, consider using irregular meeting sizes - like focused 15-20 minute sessions followed by 5-10 minute breaks. This strategy can help you stay on track and maximize your productivity.

**The Science of Attention Spans: Why Meetings Should Be Kept Short**

Our brains have an ultradian rhythm that tells us we can focus for only 90-120 minutes before we need a rest. And if a meeting exceeds 60-90 minutes, attention plummets significantly! In fact, studies have shown that meetings lasting beyond this time frame can lead to significant decreases in productivity.

**The Great Meeting Experiment: How Frequent Meetings Can Harm Your Productivity**

A study by Stanford University found that employees who attended frequent meetings experienced a staggering 30% decrease in productivity. This is because meetings often disrupt the natural flow of work, requiring team members to constantly switch between tasks.

So what's the solution? Take cues from Jeff Bezos' famous 2-pizza rule: if the number of people in the meeting can't share two pizzas, it's time to break it up into smaller, async discussions. And if a meeting needs more than two pizzas, it's probably too big anyway and should be broken down into multiple conversations (or even an async update through email or Slack!)

**Establish Clear Objectives and Conclude Upon Achievement**

Define the purpose and objectives of each meeting in advance, ensuring that all attendees understand its relevance and significance. This clarity helps determine whether attendance is justified and enables participants to prioritize their time more effectively.
Moreover, setting clear objectives also allows meetings to conclude naturally when their goals are met, freeing up time for more important activities and enhancing productivity.

**Conclusion**
Long meetings can be a productivity killer, but by using the right strategies, you can stay focused and get more done in less time. Remember to keep your meetings short, sweet, and focused - and don't be afraid to break things up if they're getting too big!
