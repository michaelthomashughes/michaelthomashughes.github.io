## The Agileship of the Ring

In the dark land of corporate tech, a powerful and insidious force had arisen: SAFeron, the Dark Lord of Agile Methodologies. His power was rivaled only by that of the one framework that bound engineers to his will.

The SAFe certs held a strange allure, promising power and prestige to those who donned them. The Three Director-Lords, who governed the realms of Product Management, Engineering, and Quality Assurance, were seduced by SAFeron's promises. They pursued the Three certs:

- SAFe 1.0
- SAFe 2.0
- SAFe 3.0

As they delved deeper into the world of certs, they began to lose sight of true greatness: the creation of beautiful and meaningful software.

The Seven Mortal Managers, who toiled in the depths of the corporate hierarchy, were tempted by SAFeron's promise of power and prestige. They pursued the Seven certs:

- SAFe 1.0
- SAFe 2.0
- SAFe 3.0
- SAFe 4.0
- SAFe 5.0
- SAFe 6.0
- SAFe 7.0

But as they donned each cert, the inhabitants of Middle-Management felt a creeping sense of control being exerted over them by SAFeron's dark magic.

And at the very center of this web of influence was the one framework that bound engineers to his will. This single framework held the power to bend all engineers to his will, and those who took part in a quarterly PI planning session were forever changed.

As the Dark Lord's influence spread far and wide, a small group of engineers in the land of Backend remained untouched by its power. Simple folk, skilled craftsmen who wove software with love and care, guided by a deep connection to technology and a passion for creating beautiful and meaningful software. Unaware of the Dark Lord's schemes, they continued on their quiet path, crafting software that brought joy to those who used it. And in the shadows, SAFeron's dark magic whispered its influence, waiting for the day when the engineer's creations would be bound... by his framework.
