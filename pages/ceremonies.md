title: Evolution of Ceremonies in Agile Development
---

Agile ceremonies can be useful, but traditional Scrum sprints are often too rigid. In Kanban, it's better to:

* **Adapt ceremonies**: Make them more informal and flexible
* **Focus on principles**: Prioritize collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement

**Informalize Ceremonies:**

* Retrospectives become "quick wins" sessions
* Stand-ups become brief catch-up meetings
* Sprint reviews become a "Done!" celebration
* Daily meetings are brief check-ins

By embracing an adaptable approach, teams can prioritize flow and adaptation over rigid structure and numerous formalised ceremonies.
