title: Development is a Marathon not a Sprint
---

Traditional Scrum sprints create unnecessary pressure and inflexibility, leading to:

* Rushed work and burnout
* Inflexible planning that can't adapt to changing priorities or new information
* Focus on deliverables rather than value creation

**The Way Forward:**

Abandon sprints in favor of **continuous development**, focusing on **kanban-style workflows**. This approach:

* Emphasizes adaptability and flexibility
* Prioritizes delivering value over timeboxes
* Encourages iterative improvement and learning

By ditching sprints, teams can focus on creating real value for their customers, rather than trying to fit into a rigid schedule.
