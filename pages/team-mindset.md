title: Team vs Individual Mindset
---

**Individual-focused Scrum:**

* Concentrates on individual team members' roles, responsibilities, and workflows.
* Places emphasis on personal accountability, sprint goals, and daily stand-ups.

**Team-oriented Kanban:**

* Emphasizes collaboration, communication, and shared responsibility among team members.
* Focuses on team-level workflow, with a focus on limiting work in progress (WIP) and maximizing throughput.

**The Power of Teamwork**

Kanban teams offer a unique advantage when it comes to teamwork. By working together towards a common goal, team members can:

* Share knowledge and expertise
* Coordinate efforts and maximize output
* Foster a culture of continuous improvement and feedback

In Kanban teams, each member plays a vital role in the workflow, and everyone contributes to the overall success of the project. This collaborative approach helps to build 
trust, improve communication, and drive innovation.

Ultimately, whether you choose Scrum or Kanban depends on your team's unique needs, values, and goals. But one thing is clear: teamwork is essential for delivering 
successful projects in Agile environments.
