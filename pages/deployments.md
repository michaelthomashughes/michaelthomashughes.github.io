title: Once in a Blue Moon Deployments
---

Monthly releases can create a sense of urgency and stress among developers. The pressure to meet a fixed deadline can lead to:

* Rushed code deployments
* Increased bugs and defects
* Limited opportunities for feedback and iteration

**The Benefits of Frequent Deployments**

On the other hand, frequent deployments using Continuous Delivery and Kanban principles offer numerous advantages:

* **Faster Time-to-Market**: Get your software in users' hands faster, with new features and improvements delivered regularly.
* **Improved Quality**: Catch bugs and defects earlier, through continuous testing and validation.
* **Increased Collaboration**: Encourage teamwork and knowledge sharing among developers, QA, and stakeholders.
* **Adaptability**: Quickly respond to changing market conditions and user feedback.

**What's Holding Us Back?**

* Fear of change
* Limited resources or infrastructure
* Lack of understanding about Continuous Delivery and Kanban principles

**Let's Make the Leap!**
