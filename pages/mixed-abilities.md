Kanban is a more suitable approach for teams with mixed abilities, such as Mediocre Michael and Ridiculous Ruth. Here's why:

1. **Flexibility**: Kanban allows for the team to adjust its workflow and pace according to individual member strengths and weaknesses. In this case, Ruth can take on more 
work when Michael is struggling, while Michael can still contribute with smaller tasks or support Ruth.
2. **Visual management**: Kanban boards provide a visual representation of the work, making it easier to track progress, identify bottlenecks, and allocate tasks 
accordingly. This helps Ruth and Michael understand where each other's strengths lie and how they can collaborate more effectively.
3. **No strict workloads**: Unlike traditional Waterfall or Agile methodologies, Kanban doesn't assign rigid work loads or deadlines. Instead, it focuses on continuous flow 
and adaptation. This allows Ruth to help Michael without feeling overwhelmed or stuck in a specific role.
4. **Pull-based workflow**: In Kanban, tasks are pulled into the workflow based on priority and capacity. When Michael is struggling with a particular task, Ruth can take 
over that task or suggest an alternative solution. This approach ensures that both team members have opportunities to contribute without feeling overwhelmed.
5. **Less emphasis on individual performance**: Kanban focuses on team velocity, lead time, and cycle time rather than individual performance metrics. This shifts the focus 
from "how much work I can do" to "what's the best way for our team to deliver value?" Ruth can help Michael without worrying about meeting her own workload targets.
6. **Improved communication**: Kanban encourages open communication between team members, which is essential in a mixed-ability team. Ruth and Michael can discuss their 
strengths, weaknesses, and workloads, ensuring they're both aware of each other's capabilities and limitations.

> By embracing the principles of Kanban, Mediocre Michael and Ridiculous Ruth can work together more effectively, leveraging Ruth's strengths to support Michael's growth and 
development. This approach helps create a positive team dynamic where everyone feels valued and empowered to contribute in meaningful ways.
