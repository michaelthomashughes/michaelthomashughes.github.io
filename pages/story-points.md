title: Story Pointing vs Cycle Time
---

Scrum Story Pointing relies on estimating the complexity or effort required for each task, typically using a relative scale (e.g., 1-5). This approach can lead to:

* **Estimation uncertainty**: Estimating is inherently subjective and prone to bias.
* **Task prioritization bias**: Tasks with higher story points are often prioritized over those with lower estimates, even if they're not necessarily more valuable.

Kanban Cycle Time, on the other hand, focuses on the actual time it takes for a task to move through the workflow (i.e., from start to finish). This approach provides:

* **Measurable accuracy**: Cycle times are directly observable and objective.
* **Value alignment**: Tasks with shorter cycle times tend to be more valuable or time-sensitive.

By focusing on cycle time, Kanban encourages teams to prioritize tasks based on their actual impact and time requirements, rather than relative estimates. This leads to a more efficient and effective workflow, where the team's collective performance is measured by the amount of work completed in a given time period (velocity) and team focus on reducing cycle times for all tasks, leading to process improvements and increased efficiency.
