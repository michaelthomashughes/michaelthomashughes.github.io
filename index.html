    Hello! I'm Michael Hughes, a software engineer with experience in various programming languages and frameworks,
    I enjoy tackling complex problems and continuously learning new technologies such as GenAI which was definitely
    not used to create the content on this site! I have recently developed an interest in agile methodology and
    engineering practices, my thoughts on this are explained in the posts in the navbar.
